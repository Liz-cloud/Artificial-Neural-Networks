## Artificial Neural Networks
AND.py, OR.py, NOT.py are test files for the individual gates to see if they are trained properly

### XOR Problem:
1. Train the AND Gate
2. Train the OR Gate
3. Train the NOT Gate
4. Test if the gates have been trained correctly by checking the output compared to the expected output
5. Implement the XOR Gate by combining the (OR) AND (NOT(AND)) Gates
6. Prompt the user to enter input to use on the XOR gate
7. Pass the input into the XOR Gate
8. Output is printed

### Handwriting recognition :
1. Declare a device
2. Declare hyper variables
3. Get training data
4. Get test data
5. Check the data sample
6. View the image in grey scaled
7. Build a model of 4 hidden layers
8. Declare cross-entropy loss
9. Declare a optimizer
10. Check the size of sample
11. make a training loop for the neural network
12. Define a class to view the classification
